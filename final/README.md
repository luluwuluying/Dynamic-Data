# Dynamic Data Final Project
### My midterm project is building a search feature for the landing page. The first page of this project is a button leading to a form. You can create a name for your trip, choose the departure city, destination city, choose arrival date and return date. Based on user's choice of different cities, the database will generate a picture of the city corresponding to their choice, and calculate their travel days at the same time.
### For my final project, I would like to continue this project and move it forward with google place API.
